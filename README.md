## Woj Bot

A simple bot to post tweets from a timeline to a slack group. 
It requires some tokens from twitter and slack bot api key. 
An example of these tokens is provided in secret/secret.example.txt.

The two main source files run under python3+ (tested on 3.6 and 3.7), and all requirements are in requirements.txt.
Run --help on either src/twitter_bot_woj.py or src/parse_players.py to determine how to run.

As a side note, you probably wanna try posting to private channels to not bother other people.

As another side note, the deploy scripts are probably not useful for you. 
They're just for me to deploy to my droplet easily.
